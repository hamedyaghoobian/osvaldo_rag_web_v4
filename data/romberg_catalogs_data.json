The process which led Osvaldo Romberg to the present stage of his artistic development can be dated back to the period between 197072 during which he began classifying landscape colors black and white landscape photographs accompanied by the systematic separation of actual landscape colors. By 1973, his diminished concern with the final result on the one hand and his growing interest in the preparatory Processes on the other led to his search for the possibilities inherent in the painting medium and in the human body which executes the painting. Romberg began trying to penetrate the essence of artistic creation and its components and to analyze the creative act in its most basic realization, i.e., color, line, movement. The questions which he posed and which were formulated visually by his paintings were what is painting? what is drawing? in their absolute sense. It appears that the crystallization of Rombergs cultural and personal project - Art about Art  was begun then. In the works included in the series entitled First Investigation, the artist depicted fundamental shapes such as lines, circles and spirals by means of the basic movements of the various organs of the body.

The result was that Osvaldo Romberg manipulated the typologies of color as virtual and symbolic building blocks of painting.

His art is one of gestuality, action, process, existentiality, and not, as one might imagine, a rational theorem. What Osvaldo Romberg proposes is a poetic pollution of an intellectual issue which sensualizes a neutral theoretical system and eroticizes signification.

The view of the state of art in terms of its  synchronic cross-section or its diachronic continuity, the relative and variable hierarchies of the artists and the comprehension of their paintings are all conditioned upon the body of the text, i.e., interpretations, critiques and descriptions. This body of kunstliteratur as the term is defined by Julius Schlosser, the art historian is that which in fact dictates our perception of art history. Moreover, the transmission of artistic data and principles from one generation to the next didactics also depends upon discursive communication or  to phrase it differently  upon language the language of the teacher who interprets, creates a certain selectivity and transmits to his pupils the elements of language which are in turn transformed into visuality, ad infinitum.",

Notwithstanding this factor, there is another dimension involved in the use of paintings translated into the medium of photography !n addition to Osvaldo Rombergs professional relationship and mystical attraction to the world of museums, he is also deeply involved in the world of books through which he learned to love painting. Romberg is self-educated and the reproductions of paintings were the intermediary link between himself and the history of art and by projection, they became part of the emotional complex of his fixations concerning art. The musée imaginaire of art reproductions and books is a most definite part of ones didactic space. Teachers use them to explain and compare.

In any case, at first glance no profound intellectual rationale is necessary to explain these pleasant paintings, even though the chains of superimposed color patches do seem a bit disjunctive, since they bear no obvious relationship either to the general mood of lyrical abstraction or to the hints of a landscape presence. Even these discrepancies can be assimilated as a familiar modernist intrusionthe brushstroke made explicit, parodied a aLichtenstein, or codifiec in the spirit of say, Arakawa.

The artist demonstrates the virulence of the desire to become an artist, i.e. to express a view, how it takes years and decades, however, before he starts finding any acceptance. Therefore he starts from the assumption that a contribution to defining art and forming art is also made by those who are not devoted to it but who expressly refuse to love it or understand it. Non-acceptance is progressively turned positive.",

This means that objects presented in their real, three-dimensional and material presence function simultaneously as sculptural objects, real forms and the depiction of certain actual objects. The three-dimensional spatiality incorporates a sculptural, constructivist, quasi-architectural attitude into its physical reality, in which the constructorartist actually creates objects that portray space and take on spatial properties. The rhythm of the full and empty spatial units is sensitized by this space arrangement, i.e., the object-constellations are dynamized by an often complicated dialectic of closed and open areas of space. In this case the viewer takes his cue from the constructorartist and interprets the objects according to their primary sculptural manifestation. The dimension the geometric objects have and the materials that make up their components are taken in as real, as actual, as tangibly thingish the formations, in the context of contemporary art, are classified quite simply as sculpture,",

He testifies to the stormy era of utopian, avant-garde architecture, when it tried to design sites for the future ideal society that sprang from a utopia of world revo- lution. In the same way he works with the groundplans of sacred Greek, Mesopotamian, Egyptian or Jewish architecture, in which the room is seen as a spiritual site, a place for the presence of God, that is, as an out-of-the-ordinary, often irrational place. The utopia of the avant-garde and the religious ideology of archaic epochs converted the architectural design into a presentation of moral values. When the artist of the Eighties and Nineties works with architectural and archeological models, as Osvaldo Roimberg has these past ten years, we can conclude that the search for a validity that legitimizes formal solutions no longer leads the artist in the direction of visions of the future, i.e., no longer to utopia, but to the past, which enables him to find thematically significant reserves of meaning.",

If we want to understand what is invol- ved in Osvaldo Rombergs project, we must notice how the graphic quality of the word authenticates and lends its signature to the quality of the color. And here in my opinion is where we must look for the distinguishing mark between for example what Meyer Shapiro has called the rationalism of Seurat and the analytic rationalism of Romberg. Believing that color is subject to fixed laws, Seurat was convinced that these laws can be taught like music. For his part Osvaldo Romberg, probably remem- bering Seurats statement, has said, in a tone which can hardly fail to persuade us that he is not lacking humour  ama frustrated musician. In fact the graphism com- prising color marks which it defines entymologically cadmium yellow and in otherwise undefinable sub-classi- fications cadmium yellow plus white - cadmium yellow plus two whites, etc., which accompanies all of Osvaldo Rombergs pieces, sufficiently asserts that color cannot be",

The construction of these analytic boards with their horizontal and elongated format and the whole which they make up should also be noticed they comprise the reproduction of a painting which has marked the history of art with on both sides the nominal color range of its composition arranged in the linear order of a scriptural tendency towards discourse which signs and seals its definition.

By 1973, a diminished concern in the final result on the one hand and a growing interest in the preparatory processes on the other led to his search for the possibilities inherent in the painting medium and in the human body which executes the painting. Romberg began trying to penetrate the essence of artistic creation and its components and to analyze the creative act in its most basic realization, i.e., color, line, movement.

The artist then uses his brush to paint various details on the surface of the photograph, attempting to render his colors as close as possible to those of the original. Each brush-stroke applied on the surface of the photograph is copied ona white sheet of paper alongside the photograph as docu- mentation thus creating the color continuity which consti- tutes the color classification. Coincidently, each detail painted upon the enlarged photograph is whitened out with paint in the small reproduction in order to indicate its precise position. The placement of the details in the repro- duction is determined by a grading system which generally serves for the enlargement and reproduction of paintings. Thus, a model of restoration is created.

Sometimes it is impossible to distinguish between a shape and the arcs of color that surround it with suggestions of motion. Shape spins on its axis. Or it may be orbiting. Forms flash, coalescing from droplets of color or caught in mid-explosion. No clear boundary separates these presences from signs of their energy. And those signs often blend in with the ground.

Now, one might say Romberg has intuitively exploited the effect of the negative space of our entire history and social interchange upon the perception of particular limited installations. Thatis an advance of considerable intelligence. Itis also a piece of boldness that is peculiarly contemporary. Here, one must bear in mind what is meant by conceptual art, which is a dual phenomenon at best, only one of the branches of which has sustained a true continuity with the traditional forms of art. The important branch is the one that pretty well fulfills Hegels notion of the history of art  of art increasingly occupied philosophically with working out the nature of its own unfolding mode of functioning and of incorporating that into its own message the other, which we may safely ignore, merely abandons perceptual realization altogether. One of the consequences of this line of development is that the demarcation between painting and philosophy is erased, also the demarcation between painting and every other form of poiesis and praxis, the demarcation for instance between painting and installation. Here, we invoke the nostalgia of classical terms that, retrospectively, signify a once-unified world that modern divisions of labor have dismembered and now united in a new way - which the contemporary artist Osvaldo Romberg, now is bent on reclaiming.",

    "text": "Osvaldo Romberg was dealing with a selection of masterpieces that had influenced him as if they were toy pieces from which to generate new work, with a sweeping studious-theoretical, but no less sensuous and amusing style. The grid chosen by Romberg to serve as the basis for his work preserves the formalistic principle of a kind of a table. The table consists firstly of colour strokes that demonstrate the gradual transitions from one tone to another. Next to the matter-of-fact brushstrokes. he writes the precise name of the colour or shade. This colourful scale offered an analysis of the colours components and a demonstration of its point of saturation. Beyond that, the title alluded to the name of the work of art which was translated by Romberg into a specific colour scale for the present piece. Later, a simple reproduction was added to the colour scales of a specific work. When he started personally painting the reproductions, many people noticed his excellent control of the craft of painting. Now, alongside the reproduction and the analysis of its colour scale, Rombergs grid contained an analysis of the work in its historical-mythological context, while in another column he outlined the uniqueness of the work and its singularity. That is, in contrast to the classical minimalist grid, in Rombergs pictorial composition you can certainly hear birds singing, that is, it is not a minimalist piece, on the contrary, even, but a formalist piece that insists on telling the story of an important painting. At least for him. Either way, Romberg stands in polar opposition to minimalism. If minimalism wished to rid art of any complications, Romberg cannot think of art other than as a problem.",

The shelf containing the catalogues and books about him is quite crowded. Every summer he escapes to the wild island Isla Grande, known scarily as Snake Island, in Brazil. It has no paved roads, transport or means of communication. The Landscape is totally primordial. There, he says, he can devote time to fishing and reading his beloved writers Joyce, Kafka, Proust and of course Borges.",

The saturation of dialectical discourse, itself transcended by the crisis of representation, has left in its wake an awareness of an in-between spacea space which is the realm of Osvaldo Romberg. Situated between art and architecture, 2000-2000, even expresses the necessity of stepping aside at the end of the millennium and con- templating the universal history of mankind as viewed in Borgesian terms as a metaphor. As a Magister Ludi, Romberg combines historical metaphors through variations and permutations to produce a labyrinth where history fuses into an ensemble of philosophic paraphernalia that questions the myths and mysteries of art and art making, as well as history itself.",

In his major work of the late seventies Mythologies, from Altamira to Manetan Emotional Analysis of Art History, Romberg demystified what he claimed to be the mythology of art history and the myths of art-making. His art said in essence, art history doesnt exist, only artists exist. In his current project, the artist goes a step further he says history doesnt exist, only people, time and events exist. The 2000-2000, even project draws attention to the idea of history as a manipulated interpretation of facts. Additionally, the artists quotational use of art reproductions from Eastern and Western civilizations, images drawn from so-called evolved to so-called primitive cultures is a critique of the Modernist cult of the original and",
