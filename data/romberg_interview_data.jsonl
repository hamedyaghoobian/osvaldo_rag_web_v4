Take the example of Picasso and his involvement with Renaissance art, the many variations on a borrowed theme in his own paintings. But for the artist drawing inspiration from the past, or casting his eye back, the ingredients of change have always been crucial in his quest to define his own self and his own artistic drive, with the other work of art acting as a catalyst.

I think that this note together with the collage reinforces it. Because its nature, what is seen in it, strongly supports this statement, and from there comes the more didactic way that I can extract within the collage.

But I also grow what I did because of the mythologies that... when I was a student, it was hardest for me to understand how to make a color that reaches the color I see in reality or that I see in painting. There is one of the strongest mythologies that exist in every student who learns in an academic way in systematic color, which is how to make the color. So I, on one hand, make the color, and on the other hand, write exactly the definition of how I did it, and also in a much simpler environment. And in the end, if we turn the color from the context of nature, where the color defines the meaning of what we are looking at, the only thing we can say about the color is its name. And I think there is something very poetic about it that we say the names of the colors."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But in a work of this type that also refers to Giotto for the Pansies, you no longer give the names of the colors."}]}

And then I think that the color here as a psychological reaction is much more festive and closer to nature and the atmosphere of the baptism, which is someone who is born, someone who receives the recognition of the viewer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are."}]}

In the last year of my degree I realized what it meant to work for a client, and it disgusted me. I had to impose ideas that I could not accept because, for economic reasons, whoever finances, commands. While in art one does what one wants, production is very different from that of an architect. On the other hand, the limitation is not only money: the first is the user, it is a logical demand, each person has a certain way of living, which is not limited by the architect."}]}

I cut out xerox prints of the surrealistic works I had done in the early '80s, in which I dealt with the unconscious and with basic natural drives - death, life, biology, biomorphic shapes..., and began to work on them with color and to glue them on to wooden boards. The results pleased me, but I realized that the wood was not thick enough. So I increased the thickness substantially, and then I saw that the depth of the carving must also be increased to avoid the effect of line drawings. That is to say, it just worked out this way... things always work out for me incidentally... I think every artist achieves his important things unintentionally."}]}

But in the 70's I chose the works subjectively, so I called them 'an emotional analysis of the history of art'. This time, I thought that I would take a whole book in which I chose nothing, where my choice is irrelevant, that I would get a 'readymade', but an impersonal one, because someone else chose the works for me.

What happens when I cancel the functions of something functional and turn it into something ornamental on the wall?
